gofsim-app
==========

gofsim-app is a simple simulation of "Game of Life". The game has 4 rules basically;

  * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
  * Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
  * Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
  * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Live and dead cell pattern is generated by application randomly when application starts. Afterwards, application starts to execute the rules and iterate generations.
